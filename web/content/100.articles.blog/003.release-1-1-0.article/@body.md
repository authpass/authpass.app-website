## Multiple Password Files

Now you can easily open multiple password files at once. This way
it is easy to separate for example your personal passwords from 
your passwords for work.

You can also for example have shared passwords with collegues or friends,
simply share them via Dropbox or Google Drive and open them in addition
to your personal passwords.

## Password Generator
