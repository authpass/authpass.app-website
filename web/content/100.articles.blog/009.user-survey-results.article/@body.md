After collecting your opinions throughout September we now have
a good sample of AuthPass Users. Thanks for everyone who invested
their time to provide their feedback!

Here you can find a few key statistics.

## Thanks!

First of all thanks to all respondents! Most of you who left their
email address and added some comments, I've tried to answer
immediately, but be sure all your responses were valuable :-)

On average, you took **11 minutes** out of your busy day to 
respond, so thanks :-)

## Satisfied, but still room to improve

The first survey included a question whether you would recommend
AuthPass to a friend or a colleague. Since some chose a bad score
because they didn't trust their friends or colleagues to care about
secure passwords üòÖÔ∏è this time was just about YOUR satisfaction.

Lets break this down by Operating System. (Note that this is the 
operating system used to respond to the survey, not necessarily the
OS used with AuthPass).

{{render content=node.embed.figures.satisfactionOsType /}}

Seems like we are still having room to improve üòÖÔ∏è Although
Android users look to be a bit more satisfied than iOS and
macOS users.

## Who is using AuthPass?

Most users answering the survey seem to be Android users.
This is a bit contrary to user analytics which shows many
more iOS users than Android users. The main reason probably
being, that many Android Users are actually from F-Droid which
does not include Google Analytics. Hence, those users are 
invisible to measuring user interactions using analytics.

!!! question "ü§îÔ∏è"
    I'm still not sure what those 2% of *Other* are using?

## Android Autofill discoverability

Looks like we have to make autofill on android more discoverable.
Most users who are not using autofill on android simply did not
know it was supported.

## KeePass compatibility

What is obvious when looking at the respondents, is that
it is very important for AuthPass to remain fully compatible
with third party KeePass apps. Even though
AuthPass is available on all platforms, people still like
to have the choice for their favorite KeePass app on each
platform.

There are also a VERY wide variety of apps people are using.

This is certainly something which AuthPass has to take in 
account when developing new features.

There is certainly a vide variety in apps which are currently
in use, and which play nicely with AuthPass.

## Different Languages and Countries

Another field of diversity are spoken languages of our users.
Even though most people still prefer english as the main UI 
language, only 33% have english as their native tongue.

This will definitely be an area of focus in the near future.

!!! note "Help us translate AuthPass"
    AuthPass is still not fully translatable, so if you are a
    developer and want to get started with some easy tasks,
    this would be a [good way to get into contributing](https://github.com/authpass/authpass/issues/78) ;-)
    
    Otherwise if you speak another language check out our
    [crowdin translation tool](https://translate.authpass.app/authpass).
    If your language is not yet listed, just get in touch!

## More to come!

This is just the first part, I still need more time to analyse
the data and slice and dice to make sense of everything!
