# Encryption / Security

All passwords in AuthPass are fully encrypted. Your passwords **never** leave your device unencrypted and
are always stored encrypted. Make sure to remember your password as it is not recoverable.

AuthPass itself has absolutely no server component, so it will never store your passwords on a server.
But we **highly recommend using a cloud storage service** like Dropbox, Google Drive or (your own)
Web DAV. This way your password files are always backed up when your devices crashes or gets otherwise
corrupted.

!!! warning
    Do not store your password files locally on a mobile device without a backup!
