# Beyond Password Management

**AuthPass Cloud** are features to improve the standalone, offline 
AuthPass Password Manager.

Your passwords and password database are still completely in your control,
and nothing changes on the encryption. But it allows additional features
to further protect your accounts and privacy.

# Synchronize password databases between devices.

See your [news article](/articles/sync-passwords-across-devices) for how to use AuthPass Cloud to
synchronize your passwords across all your devices.

# Unlimited, Anonymous Email Addresses

With **AuthPass Cloud** you can auto generate anonymous email 
addresses for each of your online accounts. Just the same
way, how you auto-generate your passwords using **AuthPass**.

Email Addresses are completely anonymously, and you can read the
emails directly inside AuthPass. The main advantages are:

1. Every service has a different email address, so you know
   which service spams your email address.
2. Adds additional protection, as if a service is hacked, not even
   your email address will be leaked.

!!! warning
    AuthPass Cloud is still in beta. We do not recommend using
    generated emails for important correspondence, but only
    for signing up for services to receive account related 
    transactional emails.

# Enable AuthPass Cloud

To make use of auto generated email addresses you have to verify
your real email address once. This is only to prevent spamming and
keep usage under control. We only use the email address for
authentication.

1. In the password list choose 'Authenticate with AuthPass Cloud'
2. Enter your Email address
3. You will receive a confirmation link to your email address.
4. Once you received your email click the link and verify 
   that you are not a robot by checking the recaptcha.
5. You are good to go üëç

# Generate Email Addresses

After you have authenticated you can simply create an email address
by clicking the `Generate Address` beside any entry value:

# Read your Emails

Although every account will receive its own email address, all
emails can still be seen through one common interface.

Just like before for Authentication select `AuthPass Mailboxes` from
the AppBar menu.

{{render content=node.embed.figures.emailList/}}

Once you open an email, you will see the **associated mailbox**
as well as for **which password entry** it was created.
