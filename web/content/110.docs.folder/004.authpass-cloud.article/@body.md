# Beyond Password Management

**AuthPass Cloud** are features to improve the standalone, offline 
AuthPass Password Manager.

Your passwords and password database are still completely in your control,
and nothing changes on the encryption. But it allows additional features
to further protect your accounts and privacy.

# Unlimited, Anonymous Email Addresses

With **AuthPass Cloud** you can auto generate anonymous email 
addresses for each of your online accounts. Just the same
way, how you auto-generate your passwords using **AuthPass**.

Email Addresses are completely anonymously, and you can read the
emails directly inside AuthPass. The main advantages are:

1. Every service has a different email address, so you know
   which service spams your email address.
2. Adds additional protection, as if a service is hacked, not even
   your email address will be leaked.

!!! warning
    AuthPass Cloud is still in beta. We do not recommend using
    generated emails for important correspondence, but only
    for signing up for services to receive account related 
    transactional emails.
